## 🧩 What's Inside

KillTheHost is a bundle of two open-source, single-file Python tools designed to eliminate the gap between local development and live deployment.

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 🐘 **PHP-MNGR** | `v2.4` | Local PHP project manager — start, stop, and monitor sites |
| 🗄️ **DB-3NGIN3** | `v1.1` | Local database service manager — PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB |

Together, they connect to your **Namecheap** domains and route traffic through **Cloudflare Tunnels** — putting your localhost on the public internet without a single line of server config.

<br/>

## ✨ Features

<br/>

```
  localhost:8080  ──►  PHP-MNGR  ──►  Cloudflare Tunnel  ──►  yoursite.com
  localhost:5432  ──►  DB-3NGIN3 ──►  Cloudflare Tunnel  ──►  yoursite.com
```

<br/>

### 🌐 Domain Sync
Connect your **Namecheap** account and assign real domains to local projects — no manual DNS editing required. More registrar integrations are on the roadmap.

### ☁️ Cloudflare Tunnel Integration  
Link a free Cloudflare account and expose local services to the public web securely. No port forwarding. No router config. No tunnel scripts.

### 🚀 One-Click Public Access  
From localhost to a live URL in seconds — perfect for client previews, team demos, and real-world testing without a full deployment pipeline.

### 🐘 PHP Project Control  
View runtime state, port, PHP version, and filesystem path for every local site. Start and stop projects from a clean interface instead of juggling terminal tabs.

### 🗄️ Database Service Management  
See which database services are running and on which ports. Spin up or shut down PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Redis, and MongoDB with a single click.
